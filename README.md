# A Win32 Raycaster App

A simple Raycaster inspired from Wolfenstein3D done by ID SOFTWARE, using the good ol' WIN32 API.
Most of the rendering code is inspired from the tutorial made by Lode Vandevenne (link: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) and I want to thank him for that.
Textures used are copyrighted by Id Software (www.idsoftware.com) and credits to Ultimecia.

Features:
- Using the Win32 API for creating the window and getting input from the keyboard
- Rendering algorithm similar to the one used in Wolf3D
- Uses .bmpx file for images and drawing sprites
- No sound!

TODO:
- Menu
- Finish the AI
- Maybe a splashscreen
