# A-Win32-Raycaster-App

A simple Raycaster reminiscent of Wolfenstein3D done by ID SOFTWARE, using the good ol' WIN32 API.
Most of the rendering code is inspired from the tutorial made by Lode Vandevenne (link: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) and I want to thank him for that.

This is educational only.
